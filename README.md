# Static Site Generator

This is a simple static site generator that I wrote in Python to practise Functional programming in Python.

It takes the files from [/static](static) into an auto generated /public directory and it generates html files from the [/content](content) directory

To run the project, you can use the following command:

```bash
./main.sh
```

To run the tests:
    
```bash
./test.sh
```
